Fake news prediction refers to the process of developing machine learning models and algorithms to automatically identify and classify news articles or
social media posts as either real or fake. This task is crucial in today's digital world, 
where misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly through social media platforms and news websites. 
The goal is to use various techniques to identify patterns or features that can distinguish between legitimate and fake news content.
